        Writing clean code is one of the most important practices in software development, as it ensures that programs
        are organized, easy to read, and simple to maintain. Clean code avoids unnecessary complexity and follows clear
        naming conventions, consistent formatting, and logical structure. This makes it easier for other developers to
        understand the code, fix bugs, and add new features without confusion. Moreover, clean code saves time and
        effort for the whole team, improves collaboration, and increases the overall quality of the project. In the long
        run, focusing on clean code is not just a technical choice, but a professional responsibility that leads to
        sustainable and successful software.
